# 3d-visualizer
To run:
* Open audio midi and select soundflower (2ch) as the output device. Make sure that the volume for the built-in output is maximized. 
* Start an application that generates an audio signal.
* Launch 3d-visualizer via xcode. Sound should be redirected to built-in output and the shapes in the 3D world should be modified according to the audio signal strength.
